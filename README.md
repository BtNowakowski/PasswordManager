## Key Features:

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**

   - New users can register with a unique username and a strong master password, which will be used to encrypt and protect their stored passwords.
   - Existing users can securely log in with their email and master password combination.

2. **Password Generation:**

   - SecurePass offers a built-in password generator that can create strong and unique passwords with customizable parameters such as length and name.
   - The generated passwords can be assigned names for easy identification.

3. **Password Management:**

   - Users can create new password entries by providing a name, and lenght.
   - Password entries can be edited to update the name or password as needed.
   - Passwords are securely encrypted before being stored in the SQLite database.

4. **Password Visibility:**

   - Passwords are hidden by default to protect them from unauthorized access.
   - Users can reveal passwords temporarily to view them when needed, without storing them in plain text.

5. **Copy and Paste:**

   - SecurePass allows users to copy passwords to the clipboard for easy pasting into other applications or websites.

6. **Password Deletion:**

   - Users can delete password entries that are no longer required, ensuring a clean and clutter-free interface.

7. **Strong Encryption:**

   - PassManager employs encryption algorithms to safeguard user data, ensuring that even if the database is compromised, passwords remain encrypted and unusable without the master password.

8. **Two-Factor Authentication (Optional):**
   - For an added layer of security, users have the option to enable two-factor authentication using one-time passwords method.

PassManager is designed to prioritize user privacy and security while offering a seamless and user-friendly experience. Its implementation on the SQLite database ensures efficiency and ease of use, making it an ideal password manager for individuals and businesses looking to maintain a secure digital presence.
